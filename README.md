# ModelX
A Supermodel Prediction Machine Learning Model
### Introduction:
ModelX (Modeling Optimization, Data-driven Estimation, and Learning eXperience) is a machine learning model designed to predict the body fat percentage of an individual based on various physical attributes such as Density, Boddy mass index etc. The higher the body fat percentage, the lesser the individual's chances of becoming a supermodel.

### How to Use:
To use ModelX, you will need to input the individual's physical attributes as features, and the model will output the predicted body fat percentage. You can then use this information to assess the individual's chances of becoming a supermodel.

### Model Training:
ModelX is a Linear Regression model, which has been trained on a large dataset of physical attributes and corresponding body fat percentages. The model has been optimized using cross-validation techniques to ensure optimal performance.

### Model Performance:
ModelX has been evaluated on a separate testing dataset, achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.87 and an R2 score of 0.99. The model was was evaluated and produced an overall model accuracy of 98%. These metrics indicate that ModelX has an excellent predictive performance and can provide accurate predictions of body fat percentage.

Comparing the metrics, the Linear Regression is the best pick because it has a better model accuracy (98%).

### Deployment:
Following the conclusion of the development phase, the deployment strategy entails the availability of ModelX both as a Web App and an API. This comprehensive approach aims to ensure widespread accessibility and usability of ModelX, catering to diverse user needs and preferences.

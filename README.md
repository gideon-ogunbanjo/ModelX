# ModelX
A Supermodel Prediction Machine Learning Model
### Introduction:
ModelX is a machine learning model designed to predict the body fat percentage of an individual based on various physical attributes such as Density, Age, Weight, Height, Neck, Chest, Abdomen, Hip, Thigh, Knee, Ankle, Biceps, Forearm, Wrist. The higher the body fat percentage, the lesser the individual's chances of becoming a supermodel.

### How to Use:
To use ModelX, you will need to input the individual's physical attributes as features, and the model will output the predicted body fat percentage. You can then use this information to assess the individual's chances of becoming a supermodel.

### Model Training:
ModelX is a Bayesian Ridge Regression model, which has been trained on a large dataset of physical attributes and corresponding body fat percentages. The model has been optimized using cross-validation techniques to ensure optimal performance.

### Model Performance:
ModelX has been evaluated on a separate testing dataset, achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 12.63 and an R2 score of 0.76. These metrics indicate that ModelX has good predictive performance and can provide accurate predictions of body fat percentage.

### Conclusion:
ModelX is a powerful tool for predicting body fat percentage and assessing an individual's chances of becoming a supermodel. By utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, ModelX can provide accurate predictions and help identify individuals who may be suitable for a career in modeling.
